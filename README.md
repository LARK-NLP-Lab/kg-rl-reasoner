# Knowlege Graph-based Reward Modeling

![Path workflow image](PathExtractWorkflow.png)

## Overview
This repository contains code for the paper 'Large Language Models with Temporal Reasoning for Longitudinal Clinical Summarization and Prediction'

Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18316

## Data
For this paper, we have utilized the ProbSum dataset, which is available at: https://physionet.org/content/bionlp-workshop-2023-task-1a/2.0.0/
o access the data, a credentialed PhysioNet account, CITI training and a data use agreement is required.

## Setting up UMLS
We utilize the UMLS Knowledge Graph to extract the reasoning paths. This requires a working UMLS installation.

Download UMLS from the NIH website: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/help.html

Then follow the instructions to install QuickUMLS https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/QuickUMLS
